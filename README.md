## ‚ùóLooking for a new maintainer‚ùó

Due to lack of time and shifting focus of its developer AntiMicroX is looking for a new maintainer willing to continue development.   
For now, this app will have only limited support and will not get any new features (unless coded by external contributors).   
[Link to discussion](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/discussions/1171)

## Description

AntiMicroX is a graphical program used to map gamepad keys to keyboard, mouse, scripts and macros. You can use this program to control any desktop application with a gamepad on Linuxüêß and Windows ü™ü.  
It can be also used for generating SDL2 configuration (useful for mapping atypical gamepads to generic ones like xbox360).

We support X.org and Wayland.

Features:

- Mapping of gamepads/joystick buttons to:
  - keyboard buttons
  - mouse buttons and moves
  - scripts and executables
  - macros consisting of elements mentioned above
- Assigning multiple switchable sets of mappings to gamepad.
- Auto profiles - assign profile to active application window (not in Wayland [note](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/issues/303)).

This program is currently supported under various Linux
distributions.

This application is continuation of project called `AntiMicro`, which was later abandoned and revived by juliagoda.

Legacy repositories:
- First AntiMicroX repository: https://github.com/juliagoda/antimicroX
- Second, maintained by organization: https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro
- First, original AntiMicro repository: https://github.com/Ryochan7/antimicro

## Installation

### Windows

Just download `antimicrox-X.X.X-AMD64.exe` from [Release site](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/releases/latest) and install it.

### Flatpak

The flatpak version is distributed on Flathub, and runs on most major Linux distributions. See instructions here: [Flathub application page](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox)

If you have Flathub [set up](https://flatpak.org/setup/) already:

```bash
flatpak install flathub io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox
```

‚ùï Flatpak package may not work correctly with wayland [(Fix available here)](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/wiki/Open-uinput-error)

### AppImage

Download from the [release site](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/releases).

It is recommended to use [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) with this package.

### Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions

Download from the [release site](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/releases) and install `.deb` package.

### Fedora

```bash
# Brazil
Server = http://lonewolf-builder.duckdns.org/$repo/$arch
# Germany
Server = http://chaotic.bangl.de/$repo/$arch
# USA (Cloudflare cached)
Server = https://repo.kitsuna.net/$arch
# Netherlands
Server = https://chaotic.tn.dedyn.io/$arch
```
To check signature, add keys:
```bash
sudo pacman-key --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com -r 3056513887B78AEB 8A9E14A07010F7E3
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 3056513887B78AEB
sudo pacman-key --lsign-key 8A9E14A07010F7E3
```
Install package
```bash
pacman -S antimicrox
```

  <code>flatpak run io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox</code> instead of just <code>antimicrox</code>
  <br>
  In some cases it may be good to add alias

## Testing Under Linux

If you are having problems with antimicrox detecting a controller or
detecting all axes and buttons, you should test the controller outside of
antimicrox to check if the problem is with antimicrox or not. The two endorsed
programs for testing gamepads outside of antimicrox are **sdl-jstest**
(**sdl2-jstest**) and **evtest**. SDL2 utilizes evdev on Linux so performing
testing with older programs that use joydev won't be as helpful since some
devices behave a bit differently between the two systems. Another method also exists, 
which can be found [here](https://github.com/juliagoda/SDL_JoystickButtonNames).

## AntiMicroX Profiles

If you would like to send the profile you are using for your application or find something 
for yourself, [here](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox-profiles) is the forked repository. If you want to report a bug, ask 
a question or share a suggestion, you can do that on the antimicrox page or on the
[antimicrox-profiles](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox-profiles) page.
