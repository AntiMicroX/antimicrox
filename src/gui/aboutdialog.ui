The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The resulting work is called a &amp;quot;modified version&amp;quot; of the earlier work or a work &amp;quot;based on&amp;quot; the earlier work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;A &amp;quot;covered work&amp;quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;To &amp;quot;convey&amp;quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;An interactive user interface displays &amp;quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&amp;quot; to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;1. Source Code.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;The &amp;quot;System Libraries&amp;quot; of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form. A &amp;quot;Major Component&amp;quot;, in this context, means a major essential component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;The &amp;quot;Corresponding Source&amp;quot; for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;2. Basic Permissions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to &amp;quot;keep intact all notices&amp;quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &amp;quot;aggregate&amp;quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the object code work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;A &amp;quot;User Product&amp;quot; is either (1) a &amp;quot;consumer product&amp;quot;, which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, &amp;quot;normally used&amp;quot; refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Installation Information&amp;quot; for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;7. Additional Terms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Additional permissions&amp;quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the additional permissions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &amp;quot;further restrictions&amp;quot; within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;8. Termination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot; margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot; font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License.

Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <string>&quot;pktiuk&quot; (since August 2020) I just want to ensure, that this very useful piece of software will not be abandoned, I decided to continue providing support for this project and make it as widely accessible as possible.

&quot;juliagoda&quot; (since March, 2018 until 2020) Wanting only to play my favourite old games that din't support gamepads, I found this project (which map keyboard keys and mouse buttons to connected gamepads on Linux) as most proper and recent. But because of poor choices of such application on the internet and since it didn't compile properly, I decided to rescue the project. However, once I finished my work (enough to enjoy playing games) I thought about sharing this code with others. Of course all information about past programmers will be held.

&quot;Ryochan7&quot; (since December 30, 2012 until 2017), I have been working on AntiMicro in my spare time. What originally started as a fork of QJoyPad and a way to learn proper event-driven programming has turned into something much bigger than I originally intended. Although I have spent a lot of time learning new techniques, finding out more about the domain of KB+M emulation, and spending Friday nights bashing my head against my keyboard, it has been a fun and enriching experience overall.

The need for this program came from me using similar programs on Windows to play several games that did not provide native controller support. Although some alternatives existed on Linux, there wasn't really anything that I felt was good enough in terms of functionality or in-game controls in order to really enjoy games that I wanted to play with using KB+M emulation. QJoyPad was the main program that I had used in the past although it had aged a lot and it didn't provide some basic functionality that I thought was essential. The project was dead as it had not been updated in several years so I decided to make my own.

Since then, I have tried to find out what the other programs do right and then improve upon it. I have also discovered some neat tricks along the way and I have learned more about how native gamepad controls are implemented in some games than I ever really wanted to know. Although there are definitely areas where this program could improve, I find that this program offers the best in-game control experience for playing older, and some newer, games that do not provide native controller support.

Development of this program is not as high of a priority for me anymore. This is mainly due to the fact that the Steam Controller works pretty well for the task of playing PC games compared to using an Xbox 360 controller. However, it does look like there is still a reason for this program to exist for a while.

As of May 24, 2016, this project has moved to https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro. 
Additionally, project management has passed from Travis (Ryochan7) to the AntiMicro organization due to Travis having other interests and priorities.
As next, project has been continued since 2018 by juliagoda on antimicroX project. 
Later project has been once more moved to https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox and it's its maintenance is continued by organisation AntiMicroX created by pktiuk.</string>
